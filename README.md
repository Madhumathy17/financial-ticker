# Financial Ticker

A simple demonstration of how a financial ticket can be implemented using typescript without any third party frameworks or libraries

## Requirements

```
NodeJS - v16.13.2
NPM - 8.5.2
```

Install 'Open Browser Preview' plugin

## Run the App (Local)

```
Follow these 2 steps to run the project
1. npm start (this command runs 'tsc -p .' this enables watching for live changes, useful for dev)
2. right click index.ts and 'start web preview' to view in browser
```

## Build the App

```
npm build - builds the app, make sure the ts files are compiled nad copied to public folder.
```

## Improvements can be done

1. More styling
2. Unit tests for components to ensure parsing and update are done correctly
3. Line graph for each data with data changes available in the component
